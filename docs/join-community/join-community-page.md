<font size="5">Every week our community will have free weekly GED office hours on Zoom. That means you can go into the zoom chat room and ask the instructor any questions about the GED. This is a great place to ask specific questions and get a live answer. If you want to volunteer and lead a GED office hour, contact Mason Tang on Discord.

:::tip Exercise One
Before we get started, let's do a quick exercise that won't take you more than 5 minutes.

<br />

Please introduce yourself in the community Discord group in the #introductions channel to get familiar with how it works! Quickly share who you are, where you are from, and why you chose to take the GED. Doing this course yourself is completely fine, but it is always good to have a community of others, similar to you, helping you when you need motivation, and sharing in the joy when you succeed.
:::

:::tip Exercise Two
Go to the #GED Study Buddies and try to find a buddy who is starting the GED course today just like you! You will be keeping each other accountable throughout the course and motivating each other to finish. I know it may sound silly, but this is the biggest factor in increasing your chances of completing the course. Who knows, maybe you will find life long friends this way.
