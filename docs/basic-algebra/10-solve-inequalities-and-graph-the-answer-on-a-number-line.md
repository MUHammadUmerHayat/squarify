## Question One:

<font size="5">Solve the inequality and graph the answer on a number line</font>

$
\text{ }
$

$
 \Large 5x - 10 < 10
$

---

## Question One Step:

> ### 1. Add 10 to both sides of the equation
>
> $
> \Large 5x < 20
> $

> ### 2. Divide both sides by 5
>
> ### If it is a greater than or less than sign it has an open dot
>
> $
> \Large x < 4
>$

## Question One Answer:

$
\Large x < 4

## Question Two:

<font size="5">Solve the inequality and graph the answer on a number line</font>

$
\text{ }
$

$
 \Large -4x + 10 \leq  34
$

---

## Question Two Steps:

> ### 1. Subtract 10 on both sides
>
> $
> \Large -4x \leq 24
>$

> ### 2. Divide both sides by -4
>
> ### When you divide by a negative number, the inequality sign flips
>
> ### If it is a greater than or equal to sign, the dot is shaded in
>
> $
> \Large x \geq - 6
>$

## Question Two Answer:

$
\Large x < 4

## Word Problem Question:

<font size="5">Marcos bought a bicycle worth 300 dollars. He has 100 dollars in the bank and makes 10 dollars an hour. How many hours of working will Marcos take to pay off his bicycle?</font>

$
{\text{ }}
$

$
\text{A) }10
$

$
\text{B) }15
$

$
\text{C) }20
$

$
\text{D) }25
$

---

## Word Problem Steps:

> ### 1. Setup the equation
>
> $
> 100 + 10x = 300
>$

> ### 2. Subtract 100 to both sides
>
> $
> 10x = 200
>$

> ### 3. Divide both sides by 10
>
> $
> x = 20
>$

## Word Problem Answer:

$
\Large \text{ C}
